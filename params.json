Sweet!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThis gem requires Rails 3.0+ and has been tested on the following versions:\r\n\r\n* 3.0\r\n* 3.1\r\n* 3.2\r\n\r\nThis gem has been tested against the following Ruby versions:\r\n\r\n* MRI 1.8.7\r\n* REE 1.8.7\r\n* 1.9.2\r\n* 1.9.3\r\n* JRuby\r\n* Rubinius\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem \"sugar-rails\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install sugar-rails\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`sugar-rails` supports both default and customized builds of Sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rails 3.1+\r\n\r\nFor Rails 3.1 and greater, the files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use.\r\n\r\nTo enable:\r\n\r\n* Add the following line to the file `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` (or other [sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) manifest):\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\n//= require sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following default builds are available:\r\n\r\n* `sugar`                (default minified package)\r\n* `sugar-full`           (full minified package)\r\n* `sugar-development`    (full development package)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rails 3.0\r\n\r\nThis gem adds an installation generator to Rails 3, `sugar:install`. Running the generator will install the JavaScript file (default minified package) necessary to use Sugar.\r\n\r\n* Invoke the generator:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails generate sugar:install\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Add the following to your layout or view files:\r\n\r\n```erb\r\n<%= javascript_include_tag \"sugar\" %>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Customized Builds\r\n\r\nThis gem adds a generator to provide customized builds of Sugar, `sugar:build`.\r\n\r\nThe `sugar:build` generator requires Rails 3.1+ and `config.assets.enabled = true` since custom builds are made available through the Rails Asset Pipeline.\r\n\r\nRunning the generator will create a customized JavaScript file with the pacakges of your choosing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails generate sugar:build package1 package2 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the generator has been run, you will be provided with the file `vendor/assets/javascripts/sugar-custom.js`. Add the following line to your sprockets manifest to enable your custom build:\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\n//= require sugar-custom\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, the `sugar:build` generator will provide the development (un-minified) sources. If you would like to use the pre-minified sources, add the `--minify` option to the generator:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails generate sugar:build package1 package2 --minify\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following packages are available for custom builds:\r\n\r\n* `es5` -  Shim methods that provide ES5 compatible functionality. This package can be excluded if you do not require legacy browser support (IE8 and below).\r\n* `object` -  Object manipulation, type checking (isNumber, isString, ...), extended objects with hash-like methods available as instance methods.\r\n* `array` -  Array manipulation and traversal, \"fuzzy matching\" against elements, alphanumeric sorting and collation, enumerable methods on Object.\r\n* `number` -  Number formatting, rounding (with precision), and ranges. Aliases to Math methods.\r\n* `regexp` -  Escaping regexes and manipulating their flags.\r\n* `function` -  Lazy, throttled, and memoized functions, delayed functions and handling of timers, argument currying.\r\n* `date` -  Date parsing and formatting, relative formats like \"1 minute ago\", Number methods like \"daysAgo\", localization support with default English locale definition.\r\n* `date_ranges` -  Date Ranges define a range of time. They can enumerate over specific points within that range, and be manipulated and compared.\r\n* `date_locales` -  Locale definitions: fr, it, es, pt, de, ru, pl, sv, ja, ko, zh-CN, zh-TW\r\n* `string` -  String manupulation, escaping, encoding, truncation, and:conversion.\r\n* `inflections` -  Pluralization similar to ActiveSupport including uncountable words and acronyms. Humanized and URL-friendly strings.\r\n* `language` -  Normalizing accented characters, character width conversion, Hiragana and Katakana conversions.\r\n\r\nSome dependencies must be met for your custom build to work properly:\r\n\r\n* `date`   < `date_locales`\r\n* `date`   < `date_ranges`\r\n* `string` < `inflections`\r\n* `string` < `language`\r\n\r\nRun `rails generate sugar:build --help` for full usage instructions.
